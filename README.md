This Python script uses OpenCV to create a basic security camera system that can detect unusual activity, record video footage, and maintain a security log.

Features:
1) Motion Detection: Detects motion based on changes between consecutive video frames.
2) Video Recording: Records video clips when motion is detected that is recorded for 5sec.
3) Sound Alerts: Plays a sound alert when motion is detected.
4) Security Log: Maintains a log file with timestamps of unusual activities and video file locations.
